- **Prerequisites**: Analyze requirements, compose C programs, create test cases, implement structs, pointers, dynamic memory, linked lists, and stacks.
- **Tasks**: Work with given C code fragments, implement functions for copying strings to the heap, merge linked lists, detect loops, and reverse linked lists. Use memcpy() for memory operations.
- **Efficiency Discussion**: Compare efficiency of array vs. linked list operations for insertion, deletion, and access, and implement a maze-solving algorithm using stacks.

  
#### [**Lab 5**](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS122-DataStructures/tree/Labs/Lab%205)
- **Objectives**: Practice memory management techniques and array manipulation in C, focusing on dynamic memory allocation, deallocation, and resizing.
- **Memory Allocation**: Implement functions for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using malloc(), calloc(), and free().
- **Array Operations**: Develop functions to initialize, resize, and manipulate dynamic arrays, including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Error Handling**: Learn to handle errors related to memory allocation and ensure robust memory management practices.


#### [**Lab 6**](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS122-DataStructures/tree/Labs/Lab%206)
- **Objectives**: Design, implement, and test a dynamic queue using a singly linked list in C++. Learn queue operations like enqueue(), dequeue(), and recursive printing.
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of C++ programming, dynamic memory, pointers, linked lists, and stacks.
- **Tasks**: Implement QueueNode and Queue classes, including methods for queue operations, and write unit tests for each function.
- **Testing**: Create and run test cases to ensure the correct functionality of the queue operations.
  
#### [**Lab 7**](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS122-DataStructures/tree/Labs/Lab%207)
- **Objectives**: Design, implement, and test a List class in C++ using linked lists. Focus on deep vs. shallow copy, value vs. container classes, and operator overloading.
- **Tasks**: Implement constructors, destructors, copy constructors, and assignment operators for the List class. Develop functions for insertion, deletion, and printing.
- **Testing**: Write and run test cases for all implemented functions to ensure correctness and functionality.
- **Additional Task**: Write a program to compute high, low, and mean scores from "ExamScores.csv" and output results to "ExamStats.txt".

  
#### [**Lab 8**](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS122-DataStructures/tree/Labs/Lab%208)
- **Objectives**: Design, implement, test, and apply a BST class in C++. Understand BST properties and compare value classes versus container classes.
- **Tasks**: Create `BSTNode` and `BST` classes, implement methods for insertion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and destruction of the tree. Overload the stream insertion operator for elegant output.
- **Application**: Develop an application to sort strings by reading names from a file, inserting them into the BST, and performing in-order traversal to sort them.
- **Testing**: Write a test driver to test insertion, various traversals, and sorting functionality.
  
#### [**Lab 9**](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS122-DataStructures/tree/Labs/Lab%209)
- **Objectives**: Design, implement, and test a Stack class template in C++. Learn to apply array implementations, compare value classes versus container classes, and implement overloaded functions and operators.
- **Tasks**: Implement the Stack class, complete stub functions, and build a function for postfix evaluation using the stack. Implement an algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions.
- **Template Code**: Use template code in `.h` files. Implement and test each function.
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Analyze the Big-O efficiency of `isEmpty()`, `push()`, `pop()`, and the postfix evaluation algorithm.
