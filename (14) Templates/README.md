# Templates

## Container Classes & Class Templates 

### Key Concepts 
- Class and block scope
- Access and utility functions
- Container classes
- Iterators
- Class templates

### Class Scope and Accessing Class Members Explored Further (I)
- A class’ data members (attributes) and member functions (operations) belong to the class’ scope
- Nonmember functions do not belong to any class’ scope; they are global namespace scope
- Within a class’ scope data members are directly accessible by the member functions

#### Class Scope and Accessing Class Members Explored Further (II)
- Outside of the class’ scope, public members are accessed through one of three different handles:
  - An object name, a referenceto an object, or a pointer to an object
  - Note: the “this” pointer is considered an implicit handle available only within an object
- Local variables declared inside of a member function have blockscope
