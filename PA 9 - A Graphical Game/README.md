# Programming Assignment 9: A Graphical Game or Application

## I. Learner Objectives:
**At the conclusion of this programming assignment, participants should be able to:**

- Design, implement and test classes in C++
- Apply game or application design principles
- Implement and apply inheritance and polymorphism
- Apply graphics to a solution

## II. Prerequisites:
**Before starting this programming assignment, participants should be able to:**

- Analyze a basic set of requirements for a problem
- Compose basic C++ language programs
- Describe what is inheritance
- Create basic test cases for a program
- Apply arrays, strings, and pointers
- Declare and define constructors
- Declare and define destructors
- Compare and contrast public and private access specifiers in C++
- Describe what is an attribute or data member of a class
- Describe what is a method of a class
- Apply and implement overloaded functions
- Distinguish between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference
- Discuss classes versus objects

## III. Overview & Requirements:
**NOTE:** I will be grading your assignment! Please be sure to clearly identify your team members and corresponding lab sections in a readme.txt file that is added to your "Resource Files" folder in your project. Also, be sure to add the link to your video demo in the readme.txt file. Only one of your team members will be required to submit a solution!!! Since some of your solutions may exceed the upload limits accepted by Canvas, you will need to transfer your solution to an online repository like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc.

For this final assignment, you are required to create a solution, as a team (you may have a team of up to 4 members), to a game or graphical application of your choice! Some game possibilities are listed below:
- Chess
- Texas Hold 'em
- Battleship
- Checkers
- Others?

**However, you may NOT develop a solution to the game of Snake, Pong, or Flappy Bird!!!** You must apply inheritance and polymorphism in your solution. You are also required to develop a test class and implement 5 test cases for your application.

Your goal for the assignment is to build a complete graphical, and possibly networked, game or application. As a team you must ultimately decide how you will implement graphics. You have many tools and library options available to implement the graphics portion of the assignment. Some include the Unreal Engine, SFML, Qt, SDL, Allegro, DirectX, OpenGL, etc. Please be sure to also add some directions of how to play the game or use your application.

Aside from the requirements listed in the above paragraph, you are free to complete this assignment as you see fit.

Have fun with this assignment!

## V. Grading Guidelines:
This assignment is worth 300 points. Your assignment will be evaluated based on a successful compilation and adherence to the program requirements. We will grade according to the following criteria:

- 25 pts - Appropriate design, style, and commenting according to class standards
- 75 pts - Design and implementation of main game play or application (along with user directions of how to play). **You must apply inheritance and polymorphism!**
- 100 pts - Implementation of graphics
- 25 pts - Creativity and originality in implementation of the game/application
- 25 pts - 5 test cases
- 50 pts - Video demonstration (via YouTube, etc.)
- 50 pts BONUS - Implementation of network communication via sockets

# Summary and Step Guide for Completing the Assignment

## Understand the Requirements:
- Carefully read through the assignment guidelines.
- Identify the requirements for the game/application, inheritance, polymorphism, and graphics.

## Form a Team:
- Gather a team of up to 4 members.
- Assign roles and responsibilities within the team.

## Brainstorm Ideas:
- Decide on the game or graphical application to develop (e.g., Chess, Texas Hold 'em, Battleship, Checkers).
- Ensure the chosen idea is not Snake, Pong, or Flappy Bird.

## Design the Solution:
- Outline the game/application design, including the main gameplay mechanics and graphics.
- Determine the classes needed and how inheritance and polymorphism will be applied.

## Set Up the Development Environment:
- Open your C++ IDE (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio) and create a new project.
- Ensure the project setup includes necessary header (.h) and source (.cpp) files.

## Implement the Classes:
- Design and implement the classes required for the game/application.
- Apply inheritance and polymorphism in the class design.

## Develop the Graphics:
- Choose a graphics library (e.g., Unreal Engine, SFML, Qt, SDL, Allegro, DirectX, OpenGL).
- Implement the graphics part of the game/application.

## Create Test Cases:
- Develop a test class and implement at least 5 test cases for the application.
- Ensure the test cases cover various scenarios and edge cases.

## Create a Menu:
- Implement a user interface with a menu that includes options for the game/application.
- Include directions for how to play the game or use the application.

## Test the Application:
- Run the program and validate outputs against expected results.
- Debug any issues that arise during testing.

## Prepare Documentation:
- Write a readme.txt file including team members, lab sections, and a link to the video demo.
- Ensure the documentation provides clear instructions on how to play the game or use the application.

## Record a Video Demo:
- Create a video demonstration of the game/application.
- Upload the video to a platform like YouTube and include the link in the readme.txt file.

## Submit the Assignment:
- Zip the project files including code, header files, test plan, readme, and video link.
- Upload the zipped file to the appropriate Canvas assignment submission folder.
